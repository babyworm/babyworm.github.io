  오늘 있었던 시납시스 세미나에 이어, 케이던스 세미나 공고 입니다. </p> 
  
  <p>
    Synopsys 세미나는 회사 업무때문에 부득이하게 못갔습니다. UDF에 대한 이야기가 있었다고 하던데, 회사 후배들이 가서 자료만 좀 봤습니다. <br />케이던스도 역시 저전력에 힘을 기울이고 있죠? (format 전쟁중이기도 하구요 ^^; 아쉽게도 행정적인 문제로 IEEE 표준에서 약간 밀린 느낌이 있습니다만..)<br />관심있으신 분은 참석하세요.. <br /></DIV><br />

          <br /> <P class=T2><B>Keynote abstract</B></P><br /> <P>
            The ever increasing miniaturization and integration of voice, data, and video led by consumer electronics has brought low power management to the forefront of design challenges, no less equal to timing. Additionally, the ongoing trend toward shrinking process geometries and the power management complications resulting from increased device leakage has equally challenged designers and semiconductor manufacturers alike. The industry’s response has been development of optimization and implementation techniques such as multi-voltage supply domains, power shutoff, and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling coupled with new IP to address the increasing need for reduced energy consumption.
          </P>
          
          <br /> <P>
            Much of these techniques are utilized at the physical implementation after the initial RTL design creation and exploration. The purpose of this talk is to define a new methodology that supports definition and capture of low power design intent at RTL to enable automation, flow efficiency and productivity gains while bridging the gap between design and verification due to limitations of HDL.

            Incisive Design Team Manager and Incisive Enterprise Manager can read the CPF and automatically extend the verification plan to include coverage analysis of power modes and power control signals, ensuring that all power-related logic is exercised completely during the verification process. Both products automate the tasks that would otherwise require intensive human interaction, custom-software development, or are simply impossible to achieve manually.

          <br /> <P class=T2><B>Keynote abstract</B></P><br /> <P>
            As designs increase in complexity and the impact of shrinking geometries on logic design grows, front-end design teams face an increasing number of challenges, many of which can put already tight schedules at risk. These challenges include the critical nature of power, a growing design/verification gap, logical physical effects, and others, and have up until today been tackled in a serial, ad-hoc and highly iterative manner. Together this all results in a schedule predictability crisis as the actual product development time can be twice as large, or more, as the expected schedule. As a result, logic design teams need a new method to effectively design, verify and implement their RTL block and chip-level designs-one that replaces today&#8217;s methods with a concurrent and highly predictable flow, without destabilizing existing design and verification processes. In this presentation we&#8217;ll provide a framework for addressing these problems
